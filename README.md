Quest 5

Quest lets you make interactive story games – you can make text adventure games (like Zork, or The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy) and gamebooks (like the Choose Your Own Adventure books). It lets you create sophisticated games complete with graphics, sounds and videos, all without having to know how to program yourself - a full visual editor is included.

* Visual script editor. A plain English approach to programming, where you can choose commands from searchable lists, so you don't need to remember any syntax
* Highly customisable - most functionality comes from a Core library, which is written in the Quest game language (ASLX) itself
* Games support unlimited undo
* Games are fully translatable - there is no hard coded text within a game. You can translate the English template to create games in other languages - we already have support for Spanish, German and Dutch.
* HTML game output allows embedding sounds, pictures, YouTube, Vimeo clips
* XML game file format is easily editable outside of Quest if you don't want to use Quest's own editor
* Games can be played online by uploading the .quest file to [textadventures.co.uk](http://www.textadventures.co.uk/), or you can use the WebPlayer project to host them yourself on a web server with ASP.NET 4.0
* Ms-PL licence (like MIT) means you're free to create commercial Quest games, and use Quest in closed-source projects
