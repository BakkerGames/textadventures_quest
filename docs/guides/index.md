This page is for "how to" guides which don't fit in to the tutorial (and may be out of date).




Simple
------

Easy to implement using only the GUI.

Basic
-----

Be prepared to see code - but not write it. Most of these have blocks of code, but do not let that put you off; it is pretty easy to copy-and-paste a chunk of code straight into your game, then go back to the GUI view to look at it or change it.
