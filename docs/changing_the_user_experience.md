Up until now, our Quest game has been entirely plain text. In this section, we'll look at jazzing things up a bit, and, on the next section, including pictures, sounds and video.

Setting the Default Font and Colours
------------------------------------

To change the default font and colours used throughout your game, select "game" from the tree and go to the Display tab.

Here you can set the initial font, foreground, background and hyperlink colours.

Changing Fonts and Colours during the Game
------------------------------------------

You can also change the font and colours while the game is in progress. You can do this using script commands. The commands are all in the "Output" category - you can change the foreground and background colour, and also the font and font size.

Bold, Italic, Underline
-----------------------

You can use HTML-style formatting to set bold, italic and underline. For example, when printing a message, you can type this:

     This text is <b>bold</b>. This text is <i>italic</i>. This text is <u>underlined</u>.

This will output:

This text is <b>bold</b>. This text is <i>italic</i>. This text is <u>underlined</u>.

Other Options
-------------

Quest allows players to interact using hyperlinks, via the panes on the right and the command bar. You might feel this is overkill, and would prefer to have only one or two of these options in your game. You can turn these features off on the game object. Hyperlinks can be turned off on the Features tab, whilst the command bar and panes can be turned off on the Interface tab (just make sure your game can be completed if you choose to turn off the command bar!).

The Room Descriptions tab gives a lot of options for what the player sees upon entering a room. You might prefer to have the object list after the description, for example.

There are a host of options there to make your game stand out.
