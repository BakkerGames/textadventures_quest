    InitUserInterface ()

InitUserInterface is an empty method which can be imported and overwritten by the user. It is called after initializing the interface after starting or loading a game. It can be used to reload user generated stylesheet or gui elements.

This command was added in Quest 5.5.

As of Quest 5.7, an alternative approach is to add a user interface initialisation script on the _Advanced Features_ tab of the game object (turn on the tab on the _Features_ tab of the game object). This is effectively the same but can also be used on the web version.
