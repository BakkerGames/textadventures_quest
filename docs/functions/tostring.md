    ToString (anything)

Returns a [string](../types/string.html). This is most useful for converting an integer or double to a string, however it will also convert an object, script, list or dictionary to a string, prefixing the string with the type (eg, "Object: player" or "List: one; two; three"). It will even convert a string to exactly the same string!

See also [GetString](getstring.html) and [HasString](hasstring.html)

NOTE: This a [hard-coded function](hardcoded.html).
